# Document Builders 03 & 04 - Usage Guide

**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ Complete and tested
**Files**:
- `generators/document_builders_03_04.py` - Main builders
- `test_document_builders.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Overview

Spec-driven section builders that generate Documents 03 (Hero Products) and 04 (Nutritional Excellence) from structured JSON data.

### What's Different from Hardcoded Version

**Before (hardcoded in `act1_generator.py` lines 212-290)**:
- Fixed content, manual updates required
- Hero products shown as simple list with 3 benefits
- Nutritional highlights as basic table (top 15)

**After (spec-driven builders)**:
- ✅ All data from JSON (brazil-nuts.json, medjoul-dates.json, etc.)
- ✅ Complete product profiles with ALL benefits sorted by RDA%
- ✅ Workout benefits extracted dynamically
- ✅ Taste profiles, sourcing stories, customer testimonials
- ✅ Top 11 nutritional highlights (not 15)
- ✅ Nutrient grouping by type (Selenium Powerhouses, etc.)
- ✅ Multi-nutrient champions identified (3+ nutrients ≥20% RDA)
- ✅ Health benefit mapping to customer outcomes
- ✅ FSSAI compliance section with certifications
- ✅ Follows spec structure exactly

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from generators.document_builders_03_04 import build_document_03, build_document_04
from data_integration import get_data_source

# Load data source
data_source = get_data_source()

# Generate Document 03: Hero Products
doc03 = build_document_03(data_source)

# Generate Document 04: Nutritional Excellence
doc04 = build_document_04(data_source)

# Or generate both at once
from generators.document_builders_03_04 import generate_documents_03_04
doc03, doc04 = generate_documents_03_04(data_source)
```

### Integration into act1_generator.py

**Replace lines 212-290** with:

```python
from generators.document_builders_03_04 import build_document_03, build_document_04

# Replace existing hardcoded Document 03 section with:
md += build_document_03(data_source)

# Replace existing hardcoded Document 04 section with:
md += build_document_04(data_source)
```

## Document 03: Hero Products

### Structure

1. **Hero #1: Brazil Nuts**
   - World's richest selenium source (254.5% RDA)
   - Why selenium matters (thyroid, immunity, antioxidant)
   - Sourcing story (wild-harvested Amazon)
   - Taste profile (creamy, earthy, buttery)
   - Complete nutritional profile (ALL benefits sorted by RDA%)
   - Why it's Hero #1 (brand DNA demonstration)

2. **Hero #2: Medjoul Dates**
   - Amazon's 5+ year bestseller
   - Operational advantage (India's only cold chain)
   - Pre & Post-Workout Benefits (dynamic from JSON)
   - Taste profile (flavor evolution, texture journey)
   - Complete nutritional profile (ALL benefits)
   - Why it's Hero #2 (operational excellence)
   - Customer testimonials (46% repeat rate)

3. **Why These 2**
   - Complementary storytelling (nutritional vs operational)
   - Together they demonstrate brand DNA
   - Why not others (all excellent, but these most emblematic)

4. **Hero Promise**
   - 4 promises extracted from hero analysis
   - Hero standard = floor standard (all products meet this)
   - Data sources and confidence score

### Data Sources

- `products/brazil-nuts.json` - Complete product data
- `products/medjoul-dates.json` - Complete product data including workoutBenefits

### Output

- **Length**: ~7,760 characters (~1,066 words)
- **Format**: Markdown with headers, bullets, bold formatting
- **Quality**: 100% from JSON, no hardcoded content

1. **Nutritional Philosophy**
   - "We let the data speak" quote
   - 3 specific examples (254.5% vs "high in")
   - Why specificity matters
   - FSSAI compliance promise

2. **Top 11 Nutritional Highlights**
   - Ranked table (Rank | Product | Nutrient | RDA% | Claim)
   - All nutrients with RDA ≥ 20% extracted
   - Sorted by RDA% descending
   - Top 11 shown (not 15)

3. **Detailed Nutrient Profiles**
   - Products grouped by nutrient type:
     - Selenium Powerhouses
     - Manganese Champions
     - Vitamin E Leaders
     - Magnesium Sources
   - Multi-Nutrient Champions (3+ nutrients ≥20% RDA)

4. **FSSAI Standards & Compliance**
   - 3 thresholds explained (10%, 20%, 30%)
   - How we exceed standards
   - Third-party verification
   - Certifications listed (FSSAI, HACCP, ISO 22000, FSSC)

5. **Health Benefit Mapping**
   - 6 major health goals mapped to nutrients:
     - Thyroid Support (Selenium)
     - Bone Health (Manganese, Phosphorus, Magnesium)
     - Antioxidant Protection (Vitamin E, Selenium)
     - Energy & Performance (Natural Sugars)
     - Immune Function (Copper, Selenium, Zinc)
     - Heart Health (Magnesium, Healthy Fats)
   - Product recommendations per goal
   - How to use the map

### Data Sources

### Output

- **Length**: ~6,534 characters (~967 words)
- **Format**: Markdown with tables, headers, bullets
- **Quality**: 100% from JSON, dynamically generated

- Product JSON structure changes
- New hero products added
- FSSAI standards change

### How to Update

1. Read updated spec file
2. Modify relevant builder function
3. Run tests: `python3 test_document_builders.py`
4. Verify all checks pass
5. Update this README if structure changes
