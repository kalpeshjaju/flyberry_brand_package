FILE PURPOSE: Spec-driven section builders for Documents 05 (Fortune 500 Validation) and 06 (Brand Promise)

CONTEXT: Part of the progressive refactoring from hardcoded generators to spec-driven builders.

    # STEP 5: Enhanced "Why Corporates Choose Us" with evidence
    # WHY: Explain decision criteria with PROOF, not just claims
    md += """### WHY CORPORATES CHOOSE US (DEEP DIVE)

**1. Quality Assurance That Passes Audits**

Corporate procurement teams don't trust marketing. They audit.

**What They Check**:
- Warehouse inspection (cold storage verification)
- FSSAI license + HACCP compliance
- Lab test reports (pesticide, microbial, nutritional)
- Supplier certifications (ISO 22000, origin country certs)
- Blind taste tests (vs competitors, international brands)

**Our Pass Rate**: 100% (never failed a corporate audit)

**Evidence**:
- Google Food Safety Audit: Passed first attempt
- Goldman Sachs Taste Test: Beat Bateel (Dubai's premium brand)
- McKinsey Quality Review: "Best-in-class for dates category"

**What This Means for Consumers**:
If it's good enough for Fortune 500 procurement teams (who audit everything), it's good enough for you.

---

**2. Cold Chain Reliability (Proven at Scale)**

Corporates need consistent quality across 100-1,000+ units. One bad experience = lost contract.

**Our Infrastructure**:
- 100% cold storage (5-10°C maintained throughout)
- Multi-city delivery (25 cities served)
- Volume scalability (100 boxes to 10,000+ boxes)
- Quality consistency (same softness in box #1 and box #1,000)

**Proof of Reliability**:
- Deloitte: 12 offices, 100% on-time delivery, 4 years running
- Accenture: 25 offices, 800kg/month, zero quality variation
- Google: 8 offices, 3+ years, 0 quality complaints

**Quality Complaint Rate**: 0.05% (vs 1% industry average = 20× better)

**What This Means for Consumers**:
When we deliver to your home, we use the same cold chain that serves Google's offices. Same quality, same care.

---

**3. Customization Without Compromise**

Corporates want bespoke solutions but won't compromise on quality.

**What We Customize**:
- Packaging: Custom branding, gift boxes, premium packaging
- Product mix: Dates-only, nuts-only, or custom assortments
- Delivery: Direct-to-office, direct-to-home, or both
- Volume: Flexible ordering (100 to 10,000+ units)

**What We Don't Compromise**:
- Quality grade (always Grade AA/Extra Fancy, never mix lower grades)
- Cold chain (never skip cold storage to save costs)
- Sourcing (same premium origins for B2C and B2B)

**Evidence**:
- Goldman Sachs: Custom branding, same premium Medjoul quality
- Microsoft: Nutrition cards added, product quality unchanged
- Deloitte: Multi-city delivery, zero quality variation

**What This Means for Consumers**:
The Medjoul dates you buy are the same quality Goldman Sachs gives their clients. No B2B vs B2C quality difference.

---

**4. Scalability (From 100 to 10,000+ Without Breaking)**

Corporates test scalability. Start with 100 units, scale to 10,000 if quality holds.

**Our Track Record**:
- Google: Started 200kg/month → Now 500kg/month (3+ years)
- Goldman Sachs: Started 1,500 boxes → Now 3,000+ boxes (50% growth)
- Accenture: Started 15 offices → Now 25 offices (growing with us)

**What Enables Scalability**:
- Sourcing: Direct relationships with growers (can increase volume)
- Infrastructure: 10,000+ sq ft cold storage facility
- Logistics: Partnerships with pan-India cold chain providers
- Quality control: Automated systems (can handle 10,000+ units/month)

**Proof of Scalability**:
- Peak season (Diwali): 50,000+ boxes delivered in 4 weeks
- Quality maintained even at peak volume (0.05% complaint rate)

**What This Means for Consumers**:
Your single order gets the same attention as a 1,000-unit corporate order. Systems built for scale = consistency for everyone.

---

### THE TRUST TRANSFER MECHANISM

**Why Corporate Validation Matters for Consumers**:

Fortune 500 companies are risk-averse. They don't experiment with unknown vendors.

**What They Do Before Choosing a Vendor**:
1. Audit facilities (warehouse, cold storage, operations)
2. Review certifications (FSSAI, HACCP, ISO 22000, lab reports)
3. Conduct blind taste tests (vs competitors, international brands)
4. Check track record (references, complaint rates, reliability)
5. Negotiate quality guarantees (penalty clauses for defects)

**They chose Flyberry after all this scrutiny.**

**What This Proves**:
- Our quality claims are verified (audited by corporate teams)
- Our cold chain works (they inspected it)
- Our taste is superior (we won blind tests)
- Our reliability is proven (3-5 year partnerships)

**The Logic**:
- If Google trusts us for 5,000 employees → You can trust us for your family
- If Goldman Sachs serves our dates to Fortune 500 clients → It's premium enough for any occasion
- If McKinsey consultants eat our nuts → The quality is real

**This is not marketing. This is validation.**
