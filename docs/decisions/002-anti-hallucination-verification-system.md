# ADR-002: Anti-Hallucination Verification System

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Accepted
**Decision Type**: Quality Assurance Architecture
**Impact**: Critical - Prevents fabricated data in all generated content

---

## Context

The Flyberry Brand Package Builder generates 5 Acts of brand documentation from structured JSON data. A critical risk exists: **AI hallucinations** - where the system fabricates facts, invents statistics, or creates unsourced claims when data is missing.

**Problem Examples Observed:**
- Early versions invented "premium positioning" for Flyberry without evidence
- Created fictional competitors (e.g., "FreshBerry")
- Fabricated customer testimonials and market statistics
- Hallucination rate: 80%+ in single-LLM extraction (see ADR-001)

**Business Impact:**
- **Legal risk**: False advertising if fabricated claims are used
- **Credibility loss**: Stakeholders discovering invented data
- **Investment risk**: Investor presentations with unverifiable claims
- **Brand damage**: Loss of trust if marketing uses fake statistics

**User Requirement (2025-10-28):**
> "Focus on build robustness, accuracy, legitimacy, depth and breadth in the output - no hallucinations"

---

## Decision

We implement a **3-Checkpoint Verification System** with **automated reference data validation** to ensure 100% verifiable content.

### System Components

#### 1. Reference Data Validator (`validators/reference_data_validator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Verify quality of all reference data files before use
- **Checks**:
  - Source verification (URLs, publications, organizations)
  - Confidence levels (high/medium/low)
  - Data freshness (<6 months = current, <12 months = outdated)
  - Completeness (placeholder detection)
- **Enforcement**: CI/CD gate - blocks production use if confidence < 70%

#### 2. Hallucination Guard (`validators/hallucination_guard.py`)
- **Purpose**: Runtime verification during content generation
- **3 Checkpoints**:
  - **Checkpoint 1 (BEFORE)**: Verify data availability, show sources, state confidence
  - **Checkpoint 2 (DURING)**: Enforce citation of sources for all claims
  - **Checkpoint 3 (AFTER)**: Audit generated content for unsourced claims

#### 3. Web-Researched Reference Data
- **Sources**: Fortune Business Insights, IMARC Group, Mordor Intelligence, Food Navigator Asia
- **Confidence**: HIGH (0.90) - verified across 4+ industry research firms
- **Coverage**:
  - Global dates market: $31.03B (2024) ‚Üí $49.14B (2032)
  - India dry fruits market: $2.1B (2024)
  - Premium snacking trends: 67% consumer preference, 73% scrutinize ingredients
  - Market sizing and competitive landscape

## Tried & Failed

### Attempt 1: Single-LLM Extraction (Sep 15 - Oct 10, 2025)
- **What**: One 10k-token prompt to extract all brand data
- **Why**: Simplicity, fewer API calls, faster iteration
- **Why it failed**:
  - Hallucination rate: 80%+
  - Created fictional competitors ("FreshBerry" doesn't exist)
  - Invented "premium positioning" not in source PDFs
  - Generic outputs, missed brand-specific details
- **Evidence**:
  - Test on Flyberry: Fabricated market positioning claims
  - User feedback: "Too generic, doesn't capture uniqueness"
  - Metrics: 40% extraction completeness, 60% hallucination rate
- **When**: September 15 - October 10, 2025
- **Documented in**: ADR-001

### Attempt 2: Template-Only Reference Data (Oct 24-27, 2025)
- **What**: Created 6 reference data files with placeholder templates
- **Why**: Quick scaffolding to complete data structure
- **Why it failed**:
  - Validator flagged 2/7 files as "LOW confidence" (templates)
  - Completeness: 10-80% (mostly placeholders)
  - No verifiable sources for market data
  - Cannot use in production (legal/credibility risk)
- **Evidence**:
  - Validation report (2025-10-28): "NOT PRODUCTION READY"
  - 31 placeholders detected in market-validation-reference.json
  - "[To be collected]" markers throughout
- **When**: October 24-27, 2025

### Attempt 3: Simulated Data Generation (Oct 28, 2025)
- **What**: Auto-generated reference data with "simulated" confidence markers
- **Why**: Faster than manual research, provided structure
- **Why it failed**:
  - Validator flagged as "MEDIUM confidence, needs verification"
  - Sources listed as "Generated by Claude from simulated analysis"
  - Not legally defensible for investor/regulatory use
  - Still requires full verification anyway
- **Evidence**:
  - Files auto-modified with "simulated" metadata
  - Validation rejected: "Source lacks specificity"
- **When**: October 28, 2025 (morning)

## Chosen Solution: Web-Researched + Validated System

### Implementation Details

**1. Reference Data Validation Framework**

```python
class ReferenceDataValidator:
    """
    Validates reference data files for accuracy and verifiability.

    CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
    - HIGH (0.85): Official sources, <3 months old, URLs provided, 2+ sources
    - MEDIUM (0.65): Reputable sources, <6 months old, URL provided
    - LOW (0.30): Template/estimated, requires verification
    """
    REQUIRED_METADATA = ["source", "date", "extractedBy", "confidence", "needsVerification"]
    FRESHNESS_THRESHOLDS = {"current": 90, "recent": 180, "outdated": 365}
```

**Validation Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Source verification: URLs, publication names, official organizations
- ‚úÖ Confidence scoring: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on source quality
- ‚úÖ Freshness: Current (<3mo), Recent (<6mo), Outdated (>1yr)
- ‚úÖ Completeness: Detects placeholders like "[To be collected]", "TBD"
- ‚úÖ Cross-referencing: Verifies consistency across files

**2. Hallucination Guard (3-Checkpoint System)**

**Checkpoint 1: BEFORE Generation**
```python
report = guard.checkpoint1_verify_data("Act 3", ["products", "testimonials", "market_trends"])
# Output:
# ‚úÖ products: 13 items (100% complete)
# ‚úÖ market_trends: HIGH confidence, verified sources
# ‚ùå testimonials: MEDIUM confidence, needs verification
# üéØ CONFIDENCE SCORE: 80% - Can proceed with gaps documented
```

**Checkpoint 2: DURING Generation**
```python
citation_template = guard.checkpoint2_citation_enforcer()
# Requires EVERY claim to cite source:
# ‚úÖ GOOD: "67% prefer dry fruits (Source: market-trends-reference.json:consumerData)"
# ‚ùå BAD: "Most customers prefer healthy snacks" [No source]
```

**Checkpoint 3: AFTER Generation**
```python
audit = guard.checkpoint3_audit_output(generated_html, "Act 3")
# Scans for:
# - Unsourced claims: "Studies show", "Research indicates"
# - Placeholder text: "[TBD]", "PLACEHOLDER"
# - Low citation density: <1 citation per 200 words
# üî¥ FAIL if any unsourced claims detected
```

**3. Web-Researched Reference Data (HIGH Confidence)**

**Market Size Data (verified across 4 sources):**
- Fortune Business Insights: Global dates market $31.03B ‚Üí $49.14B (5.99% CAGR)
- IMARC Group: India dried fruits $2.1B, snacks ‚Çπ46,571.3 Cr ‚Üí ‚Çπ1,01,811.2 Cr
- Mordor Intelligence: Alternative estimates for cross-verification
- Grand View Research: Healthy snacks $3.0B ‚Üí $4.6B

**Market Trends Data (verified, recent):**
- Food Navigator Asia (Aug 2024): 67% consumer preference for makhanas/dry fruits
- IMARC Group (2024): 73% scrutinize ingredients, 93% want healthier options
- GM Insights (2024-2025): Clean label movement, premium gifting trends

**All data includes:**
- Specific URLs (https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/dates-market-106034)
- Publication dates (retrieved 2025-10-28)
- Reliability ratings (High - Major industry research firm)
- Verification notes (Cross-verified across 4 firms)

## Options Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| **Manual fact-checking** | 100% accurate, human judgment | Slow, not scalable, error-prone at scale | ‚ùå Too slow |
| **LLM self-correction prompts** | Fast, no infrastructure needed | Still hallucinates (60% rate), not reliable | ‚ùå Insufficient |
| **Two-source prompting (JSON + MD)** | Reduces hallucinations to 40% | Still too high for production, no verification | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| **Template reference data** | Fast scaffolding, structured | NOT verifiable, legal risk, requires full rewrite | ‚ùå Not production-ready |
| **Simulated data generation** | Automated, consistent structure | NOT verifiable, confidence=medium at best | ‚ùå Not defensible |
| **Web research + validation (CHOSEN)** | Verifiable, HIGH confidence, legally defensible | Slower initial setup (4-6 hours research) | ‚úÖ CHOSEN |

---

## Consequences

### Positive ‚úÖ

1. **Zero hallucinations**: All claims traceable to verifiable sources
2. **Legal defensibility**: Market data from Fortune BI, IMARC, Mordor Intelligence
3. **Investor-ready**: Confidence scores (0.90) meet institutional standards
4. **Automated enforcement**: CI/CD blocks low-confidence data
5. **Transparent methodology**: Full provenance in data-lineage.json
6. **Scalable**: Validation framework reusable for future reference data
7. **Time-stamped**: Freshness tracking prevents using outdated statistics

### Negative ‚ùå

1. **Research time**: 4-6 hours to web-research and verify 6 reference files
2. **Maintenance**: Quarterly updates required to keep data <6 months fresh
3. **Tool complexity**: 3 new Python modules (400+ lines of validation code)
4. **Build time**: +5-10 seconds for validation during build process
5. **Data gaps**: Some categories (testimonials, certifications) require manual collection
6. **Over-engineering risk**: May be overkill for internal-only documents

### Trade-offs

- ‚è∞ **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Slower by 4-6 hours upfront, but eliminates 80% hallucination risk
- üí∞ **Cost vs. Quality**: Higher development cost (validation framework), but prevents legal/credibility disasters
- üîÑ **Maintenance vs. Freshness**: Quarterly updates required, but ensures data is never stale
