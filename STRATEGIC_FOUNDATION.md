## THE FLYBERRY STORY (Original Narrative Arc)

### **ACT 1: WHO WE ARE** (Foundation & Heritage)

**The Story We Tell**:

**Once upon a time** (2015-2017):

## WRITING PRINCIPLES FOR ACT 1

### **Tone & Voice** (Learned from Reference, Applied to Flyberry):

**DO**:
- ✅ **Bold declarations**: "This isn't just dates. This is operational mastery."
- ✅ **Evidence-based**: "46% repeat rate vs 33.8% category average = brand love validation"
- ✅ **Comparative framing**: "While competitors store dates at room temperature, we maintain 5-10°C cold chain"
- ✅ **Strategic clarity**: "NOT commodity snacks. IS premium gourmet with Fortune 500 trust."
- ✅ **Experiential language**: "Deep caramel notes", "Luxurious soft texture", "Crisp without guilt"
- ✅ **Founder wisdom**: Quote Akarsh's insights from investor updates
- ✅ **Consumer moments**: "Perfect pre-workout energy", "Sunday breakfast ritual", "Corporate gift that impresses"

**DON'T**:
- ❌ **Casual slang**: No "Fly" language, no "Hey", no "Very [adjective]"
- ❌ **Generic claims**: Not "healthy snacks" - be specific "cold chain-preserved Medjoul dates"
- ❌ **Defensive positioning**: Not "indulgence but good for you" - positive framing only
- ❌ **Invented data**: Only use verified numbers from investor updates/product data
- ❌ **Copy reference**: No "reimagining food" (that's theirs) - Flyberry's philosophy is "operational excellence + honest ingredients"
