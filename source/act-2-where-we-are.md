### THE NUMBERS (Q1 FY26)

**Revenue Performance**:
| Metric | Q1 FY26 | Q1 FY25 | YoY Growth | Reality Check |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Total Revenue** | ₹9.7 Cr | ₹7.35 Cr | +32% | Good growth, but ₹38.8 Cr/year run rate (need ₹100 Cr) |
| **E-Commerce** | ₹3.02 Cr | ₹0.9 Cr | +236% | Explosive, but base was tiny |
| **Sales-in-Store** | ₹2.71 Cr | ₹2.11 Cr | +28% | Steady, mature channel |
| **Corporate Gifting** | ₹1.84 Cr | ₹2.3 Cr | -20% | Seasonal (Q3/Q4 Diwali-heavy) |

**What This Means**:
- ✅ **Growth trajectory is strong** (32% YoY)
- ⚠️ **But need 3× faster** to hit ₹100 Cr in 3 years
- ✅ **E-commerce is working** (236% growth)
- ⚠️ **Corporate gifting underutilized** (only seasonal, should be year-round)

---

### CHANNEL BREAKDOWN

**E-Commerce (31% of revenue, fastest growth)**:
- **Swiggy Instamart**: 90% YoY volume growth (51,000 → 98,000 units)
  - **Reality**: #1 channel by growth, but still small absolute numbers
  - **Opportunity**: 690 stores vs competitors' 800+ (room to expand)
- **Amazon**: #1 in Dates category
  - **Reality**: Leadership position, but dates category itself is small
  - **Challenge**: Competing with ₹100-150/kg commodity dates
- **Blinkit**: 87 stores, growing
- **Zepto**: 603 stores, newer partnership

**Sales-in-Store (28% of revenue, stable)**:
- Modern Trade: Nature's Basket, Foodhall, Le Marché (premium gourmet chains)
- Traditional Retail: Limited penetration
- **Reality**: Positioned correctly (gourmet, not mass-market), but limited scale

**Corporate Gifting (19% of revenue, seasonal)**:
- **Clients**: 52+ Fortune 500 (Toyota, HSBC, Facebook, JP Morgan, Bank of America, SAP Labs, etc.)
- **Problem**: Only Diwali/New Year spike (Q3/Q4)
- **Missed Opportunity**: No year-round corporate snack programs, wellness boxes, employee rewards

---

### PRODUCT PERFORMANCE

**Winners** (Strong repeat, high growth):
1. **Date Bites**: 1 tonne in 90 days
   - **Why It Works**: Protein (6g/serving), clean label, Instagram-worthy
   - **Reality**: Cult hit among urban millennials, but pricing (₹399/160g) limits mass adoption

2. **Medjoul Dates (Jumbo)**: 46% repeat rate
   - **Why It Works**: Taste delivers, Fortune 500 validation, gifting hero
   - **Reality**: Premium pricing (₹300/100g) is strength AND weakness

3. **Pine Nuts**: ₹3499/250g (ultra-premium)
   - **Why It Works**: Adventure sourcing story, functional nutrition
   - **Reality**: Tiny volume, but signals brand capability

---

### GROWTH TRAJECTORY

**Current Run Rate**:
- Q1 FY26: ₹9.7 Cr
- **Annual Run Rate**: ₹38.8 Cr (Q1 × 4)
- **Reality**: Strong growth, but need acceleration

**Projection (If Current Trajectory Continues)**:

| Metric | FY26 Projected | FY27 Projected | FY28 Projected | ₹100 Cr Target |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Revenue | ₹40 Cr | ₹53 Cr | ₹70 Cr | ₹100 Cr |
| Gap | - | - | ₹30 Cr | **30% short** |

**The Math**: Current trajectory gets us to ₹70 Cr by FY28. Need 2.6× acceleration to hit ₹100 Cr target.

## DOCUMENT 01: Brand Positioning Gap
**Read Time**: 5 minutes | **Next**: [02 - What's Working](#document-02-whats-working)

**What This Is**: The positioning disconnect - mid-market heritage vs premium reality.

### THE GAP

**Current vs Desired**:

| Dimension | Current Reality | Desired Position | Gap |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----|
| **Price Tier** | Premium (but perceived mid-tier) | Ultra-premium (₹3,000-5,000/kg) | Perceived 1 tier below |
| **Competitive Set** | vs Happilo/Farmley (should be vs Bateel/Kimaya) | vs Bateel, Kimaya | Wrong benchmark |
| **Perception** | 67% of taste testers assumed ₹400-600 price before reveal | Premium quality justified | 5-6× under-perceived |

**Root Cause**: Packaging looks mid-market (₹200/kg visual) despite ₹₹2,500-3,500/kg product inside.

## DOCUMENT 05: The ₹100 Cr Blockers
**Read Time**: 6 minutes

**What This Is**: What stands in the way of 3× growth.

---

### MATH OF ₹100 CR

**Current**: ₹38.8 Cr annual run rate

**Target**: ₹100 Cr by FY28

**Gap**: ₹61.2 Cr

**Multiplier Needed**: 2.6× growth

---

### CHANNEL CEILING ANALYSIS

**E-Commerce** (Current: ₹12 Cr annual):
- Ceiling at current model: ₹40 Cr
- Can contribute ₹40 Cr max without new platforms/models

**Retail/SIS** (Current: ₹11 Cr annual):
- Ceiling: ₹25 Cr
- Physical retail hard to scale past ₹25 Cr without massive investment

**Corporate** (Current: ₹7 Cr annual):
- Ceiling: ₹15 Cr
- Seasonal (Q3/Q4 spike), need year-round programs

**Math**: ₹40 + ₹25 + ₹15 = ₹80 Cr maximum at current model. **₹20 Cr short of ₹100 Cr target.**

---

### WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

**Portfolio Expansion**: Missing categories - Breakfast (granola, bars), Gifting boxes, Subscription boxes
- Opportunity: ₹₹20-30 Cr additional revenue potential

**Brand Awareness**: Need 40%+ for ₹100 Cr scale (vs current 12% aided recall)
- Investment: ₹₹2-3 Cr marketing needed

**Operational Scale**: Cold chain capacity for 3× volume, Need 20-30 more people, Inventory/logistics systems need upgrade
- Total Investment: ₹₹8-10 Cr total investment needed
