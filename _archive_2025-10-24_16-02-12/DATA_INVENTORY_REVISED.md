---

## REVISED PLAN: Smart Data Integration

### STEP 1: Copy ONLY Missing Customer Data (30 min)

**From**: `/flyberry_oct_19/source-documents/`
**To**: `/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/`

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/

cp /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_19/source-documents/14-what-customers-really-say.md \
   /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/

cp /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_19/source-documents/18-ideal-customer-segments.md \
   /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/

cp /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_19/source-documents/09-current-customers.md \
   /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/

cp /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_19/source-documents/37-customer-experience-journey.md \
   /Users/kalpeshjaju/Development/flyberry_oct_restart/input_raw_data_recreate/customer_intelligence/
```

### STEP 2: Structure Customer Data as JSON (2-3 hours)

**Create 2 new JSON files**:

1. **`customer-insights.json`**
   - Extract from 14-what-customers-really-say.md
   - Structure: { painPoints: [], valueDrivers: [], sentiment: {}, reviews: [] }

2. **`customer-segments.json`**
   - Extract from 18-ideal-customer-segments.md
   - Structure: { segments: [{ name, clv, jobsToBeDone, purchaseTriggers }] }

### STEP 3: Create Missing Content (6-8 hours)

1. **origin-stories.json** (2-3 hours)
   - Research terroir for each product
   - Jordan Medjoul: Why it's special
   - Saudi Ajwa: Religious significance + quality
   - Australia Macadamia: Volcanic soil, buttery texture
   - Write 10-15 origin stories

2. **use-cases.json** (1-2 hours)
   - Extract from customer reviews (261+ reviews)
   - Map products to use cases (pre-workout, gifting, snacking)
   - "Who Chooses This", "The Moment" structure

3. **founder-story.json** (1 hour)
   - Synthesize from investor updates
   - Create 3-act narrative (founding → growth → vision)

4. **Enhance products/*.json** (2 hours)
   - Add terroir details to each product
   - Add sensory profiles (taste, texture, aroma)
   - Add competitive differentiation

### STEP 4: Update Generators (1 hour)

**Update document builders to read from new JSON files**:
- `document_builders_01_02.py` → Read origin-stories.json, use-cases.json
- `document_builders_03_04.py` → Read enhanced products/*.json
- `document_builders_05_06.py` → Already reading corporate-clients.json ✅

### STEP 5: Generate Act 1 (30 min)

Run build → Get 8-9/10 quality output

## KEY INSIGHT

**User is 100% correct**: We already have ~70% of the data in `flyberry_oct_restart`.

**What we need to do**:
1. ✅ Copy ONLY customer intelligence (4 files) from oct_19
2. ✅ Structure that data as JSON (2-3 hours)
3. ✅ Create missing content (origin stories, use cases) (6-8 hours)
4. ✅ Update generators to read new JSON (1 hour)

**NO need to copy everything** - most data already exists! ✅

---

## CONFIDENCE UPDATE

**Previous**: Need to copy all data, 50-80 hours research
**Revised**: Need to copy 4 files, create missing content, 10-13 hours total

**Confidence**: 9/10 ✅

**Quality Output**: 8-9/10 (matches flyberry_oct_19) ✅

**Ready to proceed?** We can start with Step 1 (copy customer files) and Step 2 (structure as JSON).
